# Chess Position Recognition Project

## Introduction

Chess is one of the oldest and most intellectual games in the world, attracting millions of people with its strategic depth and complexity. In recent decades, technology has advanced rapidly, and artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly significant role in various aspects of life, including games. One interesting application of AI is the recognition and analysis of chess positions using computer vision.

### Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a software tool that, using neural networks, can analyze an image of a chessboard, determine the position of the pieces, and transfer them to a digital chessboard. This will automate the process of inputting chess positions, which can be useful for conducting chess tournaments, training, and analyzing games.

## Project Tasks

During the course of this work, the following tasks will be addressed:

1. **Collection and preparation of a dataset of chessboard images.**
2. **Training a neural network to recognize chess pieces and their positions on the board.**
3. **Developing an algorithm to transfer the recognized position to a digital chessboard.**
4. **Testing and evaluating the accuracy of the developed software tool.**

## Conclusion

The use of artificial intelligence and computer vision in chess opens up new opportunities for both amateur and professional players of this ancient game, making it even more accessible and engaging. The implementation of this project will demonstrate the potential of modern technologies in automating and improving processes related to chess.
